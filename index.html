            Hi :)<br><br>
            My name is <span style="display: inline; background-color: yellow;"><strong>Yash Shah</strong></span>. I am a second-year Computer Science major at University of California, San Diego.
            The reason why I chose major in CS goes back to the first ever computers course that I took when I was in second grade.
            Microsoft was very popular around that time. I remember the teacher taking us to the computer lab. 
            We were all made to sit in pairs and asked to open <code>Microsoft Paint</code>. Being a kid, painting on the computer screen, 
            using different colors, making lines, circles, curves, and showing off our paintings to fellow classmates was very amusing.
            As I grew older, I learnt more and more topics in Computer Science. From <code>MS Word</code> to <code>MS Excel</code>, <code>MS Powerpoint</code>, <code>Logo</code> (my first programming language),
            <code>HTML</code>, <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>C++</code>, and so on. My interest in computers had developed so much by the time I was in twelfth grade that I 
            decided to major in CS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Part of the reason why my interest in CS started developing with MS Paint is my continued obsession with painting.
            <span><b>I like to paint</b></span>. You will probably see folders full of paintings when you come to visit me!
            Among the many paintings that I have made, I present a few of them and the intention behind doing them.

                - Freehand drawings have taught me that there is so much symmetry in various life forms
